# gRPC Demo / Proto / Chapter 1

In this demo, you will learn:

- Supported data types in `proto3` syntax
- Defining a simple Message
- Defining a simple Enum
- Defining a simple Service
- Import other proto files
- Generating code for multiple languages with a single command

## package instrument.v1

`instrument.v1` mimics a simple instrument API which allows creating and reading instruments which are stocks, funds and many other invesment sources.

- Each instrument may have multiple trading pairs.
- Each trading must have min/max thresholds for trading.

In this demo, you will create related proto definitions to meet these requirements.

## Buf

[Buf](https://buf.build) is a software that provides:

- Generate, lint, and control over protobuf files via CLI
- Remote protobuf repository
- VCS for protobuf repositories
- Remote code generation plugins
- Organizational protobuf management

You may use its CLI only or utilize its developer platform to manage protobuf projects in your organization.

### Installation

You may install `buf` CLI via Homebrew.

```sh
brew install buf
```

### Code Generation

You may generate `proto` code by running:

```sh
buf generate
```

### Export Generated Code

To start with simplicity, export of the generated code will be directly moving folder to related project.

However, there are other options:

- Using seperate git repositories for both proto definitions and generated code. In this approach, you will need to build a CI that generates code and push to the other repository on merge requests or direct pushes.
- Using a managed remote registry, e.g. BSR (Buf Schema Registry), will help you to push your generated code in unique commits. Which makes it easier to import necessary versions only.

### Using BSR (Extras)

#### Setup

Create an account on [Buf Website](https://buf.build).

Generate an access token on [User Settings](https://buf.build/settings/user).

Login into Buf registry via CLI by running the following command:

```sh
buf registry login buf.build --username "<username>"
```

Paste your access token to the terminal and press `Enter`.

#### Push

If you want to manage your protobuf projects on [Buf Registry](https://buf.build):

1. Create a repository on `https://buf.build/<username>/repositories`
2. Add the following section to `buf.yaml`
    ```yaml
    version: v2
    modules:
        - name: buf.build/<username>/<repository>
    ```
3. If you want to push your changes, run `buf push`. You should see something similar to:
  ```
  buf.build/<username>/<repository>:<commit_hash>
  ```
4. Your messages will be documented including any comments added above definitions.
